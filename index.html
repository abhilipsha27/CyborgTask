    <h3 class="title">Section One</h3>
    <h4 class="paragraph">The pain itself is a lot of pain Are they cheering for others? For us, the choices, the convenience,
    the pain, the pains that make the seasons fun, but the consequences are easy, here's our least hated.
    They carry messages of their present, with the flattery of some wise laborer, the very architect of
    life. When you find the least pleasures of the advantageous in times when it is easy, and when it
    takes some choice to exist, and, let no pain escape from lust, let it please the most worthy to escape
    the laborious flight! Whence it will come to pass, that any one may please the coaxing of pleasure
    and pain, avoid the pain, and be countered by reason. They provide a distinction between the methods
    of pain, and when they forsake our time, our pleasure averts any exertion, as when we receive the pain
        from the consequences, and go further into their periods. Snacks at times out, everyone!</h4>

    <h3 class="title">Section Two</h3>
    <h4 class="paragraph">If you have in-depth knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3, you can make a one-page responsive
        photography site. Use flexbox and media queries for responsiveness. Add the company name
        with an image (related to photography) on the top (landing page). Below that showcase your
        work adding multiple images. Mention the contact detail of the photographer at the bottom
        (footer). Add a button to view your work. This button will directly bring you down to the
        images section. You need to take care of the margin, padding, color combination, font-size,
        font-style, image size and styling of a button.</h4>

    <h3 class="title">Section Three</h3>
    <h4 class="paragraph">If you have a little bit of knowledge of Javascript then you can create a webpage of
        technical documentation. It requires knowledge of HTML, CSS and basic javascript.
        Divide the whole webpage into two sections. The left side creates a menu with all the
        topics listed from top to bottom. Right side you need to mention the documentation or
        description for the topics. The idea is once you click on one of the topics in the left
        section it should load the content on the right. For click, you can use either javascript or
        CSS bookmark option. You don’t need to make it too fancy, just give it a simple and descent
        look, that looks good for technical documentation. </h4>
